Only submit security issues to this repository if you are **100%** sure it is caused by the front API. Most if not everything you are looking to report is in the [xNasuni/luau-interop](https://github.com/xNasuni/luau-interop) repository, which contains the fork of Luau with its changes.

Please read [xNasuni/luau-interop/security/policy](https://github.com/xNasuni/luau-interop/security/policy) instead of this security policy if you meant to submit it there.

Contact me at [transgirls.win/contact](https://transgirls.win/contact) for any immediate questions or concerns.
