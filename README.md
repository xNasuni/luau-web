Luau (lowercase u, /ˈlu.aʊ/) is a fast, small, safe, gradually typed embeddable scripting language derived from [Lua](https://lua.org).

This repository hosts bindings for Luau that targets websites, Node.JS, and Typescript. For examples and documentation, you can check out [the wiki](https://github.com/xNasuni/luau-web/wiki).

The Luau Web package uses [Luau Interop](https://github.com/xNasuni/luau-interop/) <img src="https://github.com/xNasuni/luau-interop/raw/master/assets/LuauInterop.png" width="30px" align="center"/>. It's another project I made which is the fork of Luau with rewritten WASM execution API. This package is just bindings for that other project, it comes bundled in here.
